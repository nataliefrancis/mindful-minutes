					<p>Meditation can be hard to pick up for a beginner. It's difficult to sit for hours and try to have an "empty mind". That's why mindfulness tends to be a good first step for new-comers to meditation. Mindful meditation encourages the meditator not to empty their mind just simply observe their thoughts. But the key is don't engage them. Sort of like watching traffic- if you can't stop your thoughts then instead acknowledge them by watching them go by in your minds eye.</p>
					<p>Here are a few more tips:</p>

					1. Sit or lie in a comfortable position. If you're sitting, you may want a cushion to sit on. If you're lying down, you might find it more comfortable to use a pillow under your head. Move around till you're comfortable. Try to do any re-adjustments at the beginning so that you don't break in the middle of the meditation.

					2. Focus on your breath. Sometimes this is the best way to start to calm the mind. It gives the mind something to focus on and you will naturally slow your heartbeat down. Don't force it though, let your body fall into its own rhythm.

					3. As your mind starts to calm, check in with your body too. If there are any tight muscles, try clentching them then releasing to loosen them up. In fact it might help to start at your toes and work your way up, clenching and releasing. If anything is aching, imagine putting something soothing on it and see if it feels better.

					4. Stay in the present. As your thoughts roll through your head, don't try to quiet them, but try not to follow them. We naturally think of past events or what we need to do later in the day or week. As those thoughts show up, focus on your breathing to stay in the present. And don't be hard on yourself if you can't do it right away. This is something that takes practice. As soon as you find that you mind has wandered, just bring it back to your breathing. It will get easier to do with time.
